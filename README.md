# Mock Request Builder

Welcome to Mock Request Builder, a Python package that takes the hassle out of creating FastAPI endpoints. This powerful tool uses SQLAlchemy models as input and automatically generates FastAPI endpoints for them. Imagine having a Parent model with the keys 'foo' and 'bar', and with a single command, you have endpoints for create, update, get_list, get_single, revision, and delete operations. All done automatically, saving you time and effort.
